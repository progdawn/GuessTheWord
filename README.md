# myers_GuessTheWord
Homework assignment - hangman game

Need to show the work to the user if they failed to guess correctly. 

Also, there's a issue where if the previous word was longer that the current word, then the extra letters are kinda stuck on the screen. 

It would be nice to allow the user to add their own words in the future. Won't be hard at all.
